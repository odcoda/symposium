there should be a single conversation scheduler component
- the scheduler knows exactly which participants are currently talking (i.e.
  which LLM messages are currently in flight)
- when the user sends a message, the scheduler decides whether to kick off more
  requests
- when a new LLM message or message chunk appears, the scheduler similarly
  decides whether to kick off more requests

the scheduler should take into account the following state
- which personalities already have messages in flight
- user settings / limits around the number of messages in flight
- user settings around whether the chat should be auto-response or request-only
- user settings around whether personalities can reply to chunks, or only full
  messages

if the scheduler wants to send a new message. it needs to select which personalities
will get to do it. It should take into account
- each personality's rules for replying (on mention only, anytime, eagerness)
- each personality's priority / interests
- when each personality last spoke (in time, and message history)

the code to actually send and receive messages to openrouter (or other LLM providers)
should be in a separate place from the scheduler, to simplify the scheduler
(that code is quite complex, and the scheduler itself is also likely to get quite complex)

there shouldn't be any ui code in the scheduler itself, but it can call other components
to tell them updates.

updates it should propagate to the ui:
- anytime we send a request to an LLM provider (this can render as "XYZ is replying...")
- anytime a message fragment is sent back from an LLM provider
- anytime a reasoning fragment is sent back from an LLM provider
