great! my only worry is that this plan is a bit complex for a first attempt. Let's narrow down the requirements. in
▌ particular, let's remove the tools and file editing, and support for projects entirely -- just keep the conversations and
▌ personalities in scope for the MVP. also eliminate the cli tooling. you can also simplify the global and personality-specific
▌ settings. in fact to keep it super simple let's not have any back end and synchronization at all, so all state is just in the
▌ front end and no back end or user authentication is needed. please tell me the simpler plan
