4 params per personality
Base eagerness
Politeness penalty
Politeness half-life
Mention boost

Global parameters
when to trigger
global temperature

each personality has a mention score and politeness score that we track and update per message

mention score starts at 0 increases by (mention boost) for each message where
personality was mentioned since it last messaged. When the personality talks the
mention score gets reset to 0

politeness score starts at 0 and decreases by politeness penalty every time the
personality messages (maybe with an extra multiplier based on message length).
Every message decays the politeness score by some multiplier (eg 0.8)

when we're triggered to choose a speaker we compute logits per personality

logit = (base eagerness) + (politeness score) + (mention score)

Then we compute Softmax w temperature of the resulting logits to get
probabilities, and sample w those probabilities to see which personality to
invoke

Can trigger on every user message (quiet), every message completion (medium), or
every so often with automatic timeouts (active)
