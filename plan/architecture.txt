implement the client in react

back end: use whatever language/framework you think is easiest.
back end is just crud wrappers around the db. almost all the
action is in the front end.

support multiple clients with a very lightweight server
- server requires authentication (use Clerk:
  https://clerk.com/docs/react/getting-started/quickstart)
- all settings and content get synced from server on startup
- when user changes any settings or content, automatically sync them to server

server stores all data in a simple sql database

can straightforwardly sync from server db down to local fs state with cli tool
- this tool should run directly on the server with db access
- dump settings in json format for import/export
- dump content in natural hierarchical format by project

local cli tool should also be able to run the entire application in "CLI mode"
(where it makes edits and comments directly on the local filesystem)
but don't worry about that for now.

each user has their own settings and content; sharing is not supported

settings:
- global conversation settings
- models/personalities in the chat
- personalities, their parameters, and their basic conversational settings
  (eagerness, brevity, views of other participants, etc)

content:
- conversation histories
- memory files of the personalities, and their histories
- files, their contents, and their histories
- file edits and proposed changes

to query LLMs, use openrouter. (Eventually we'll support others but stick
to this for simplicity).

use openrouter oauth https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce
to avoid needing to mess around with storing api keys
send all LLM requests directly from the front-end; the back end only exists
as a persistent store of settings and content
