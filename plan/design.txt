This is an application for having in-depth discussions and collaborations with multiple
LLM personalities on specific projects. The projects are made out of files which we are
working on together. Think of it as a combination between multi-LLM group chat and Google docs.

there are a few ways for the user to interact within the application
(1) messaging in chat. the chat should look just like a standard group DM where
  each LLM is sending messages. Note that the user can also send messages.
  - there should be large buttons to start and stop the chat. When the chat is
    stopped, all LLM requests are canceled and no new requests are sent.
(2) modifying the personalities. Each personality consists of a model (e.g. claude
  sonnet 4.5, kimi k2, etc), parameters for the model, and a system prompt.
  There are also some settings to control how to use the model in conversations
  - there should be sliders for the large knobs (eagerness, temperature,
    reasoning, etc), a drop-down for the model name, and a box for the prompt
  (e.g. how eagerly to jump in, how responsive it is to its "name", etc).
(3) editing a file. this should be a standard web editing interface, like
  Gmail or Google docs. It can be plain text only. There will be comments and proposed edits
  to these documents from the LLMs.
  - there should be highlights around the places with comments, and clicking on
    them opens the respective comments

see the "mockup 1.png" for an illustration of how these flows could look on desktop and on mobile

note that this is not an exhaustive list of ui elements, there will also be other types of things, but these are the main ones

on mobile only one of the 3 methods is visible at a time for screen space. the conversation screen is the main
one with navigation to the other two

the navigation lists the conversations, projects / files within projects, and personalities
